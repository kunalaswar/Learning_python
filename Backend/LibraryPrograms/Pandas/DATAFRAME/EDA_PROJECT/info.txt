   df.describe() # Gives Descriptive statistical Information only on Numerical Columns
   df.describe(include='all') # Gives Descriptive statistical Information of all Columns

6. Find the Name of Apps contains Astrology
   step-0: df.columns # Gives all column names
   Step-1: First find app names
      df["App"] # displays all apps names values from apps column
   step-2: Find the app names contains Astrology word
      df["App"].str.contains("Astrology") # Gives Boolean array
   step-3: pass boolean array to DataFrame object
      df[df["App"].str.contains("Astrology")] # Case sensitive
        OR
      df[df["App"].str.contains("Astrology", case=False)]  # Ignore the Case sensitive
   Step-4: Find the Number of column Names starts with "Astrology"
      len(df[df["Apps"].str.contains("Astrology", case=False)])

7. Find the Average App Rating of Google Play Store
   Step-0: Find the column Name on which we are working
      df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'rating'
   Step-1: Get all the app rating
      df["Ratings"]  # Gives all Numerical Values of 'Rating'
   Step-3: Find the mean() of Rating—Called Average App Rating
      df["Ratings"].mean()

   Step-0: Find the column Name on which we are working
      df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'Category'
   Step-1: Get all the Values of Unique Category
      df["Category"]  # Gives all Values of 'Category'
   Step-2: Get the Unique Values of Category
      df["Category"].nunique()  # Gives Number of Unique Values of Category—34

9. Find which Category getting Highest Average Rating
Step-0: Find the column Name on which we are working
   df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'Category'
   df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'Category'

Step-1: Separate OR group the category
   df.groupby("Category")

Step-2: Get the Rating of Every Category
   df.groupby("Category")["Rating"]

Step-3: Find the Mean of Rating of Every Category
   df.groupby("Category")["Rating"].mean()

Step-4: Find the Highest Average Rating
   df.groupby("Category")["Rating"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
   # Here we get First Entry is the Highest Average Rating

   OR

   df.groupby("Category")["Rating"].mean().sort_values()
   # Here we get Last Entry is the Highest Average Rating

10. Find the total number of Apps having 5-star Ratings

Step-0: Find the column Name on which we are working
 
df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'Rating'
Step-1: Find the Rating Values
   df["Rating"]

Step-2: Find the Rating Values which is equal to 5
   df["Rating"] == 5  # Gives Boolean Values

Step-3: Get the App names by Passing the Boolean Values to DataFrame
   df[df["Rating"] == 5]  # Gives 5-star Rating App Names

Step-4: Get Total Number of App names having 5-star rating
   len(df[df["Rating"] == 5])  # Gives Number of 5-star Rating Apps

Step-0: Find the column Names on which we are working
   df.columns  # Gives all column names—take 'Review'

Step-1: Find the Review Values
   df["Reviews"]  # Gets numerical values related to reviews

Step-2: Find the data type of Review column
   df["Review"].dtype  # Gives dtype()

Step-3: Convert Dtype of df["Review"] as int or float by using astype()
   df["Review"].astype("float")  # Gives ValueError because one column contains 3.0M

Step-4: Find which App review value is 3.0M
   df["Review"] == "3.0M"  # Gives Boolean Array

   Pass to DataFrame
   df[df["Review"] == "3.0M"]  # Gives app details—Index 10472 contains 3.0M
